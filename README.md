https://www.iottrends.tech
This repo contains the NRF24l01 implementation using Raspberry-Pico using MicroPython.
We have used the official MicroPython driver for NRF24l01. 
At the time of writing. NRF24l01 driver test-code(nrf24l01test.py) was only tested for ESP32, esp8266 and pyboard.
Now it can be confirmed that NRF24l101 micropython driver works on Raspberry-Pi Pico.
MicroPython Driver and application code for  interfacing NRF24l01 + with Pico, ESP32 and other popular MPU
